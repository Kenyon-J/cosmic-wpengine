## 03-02-2025- Optimize MPRIS module with Async (REJECTED)
**Learning:** For long-running, reactive tasks like MPRIS monitoring, a dedicated `std::thread` is often the better architectural choice. Moving to a polling model with `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` every few seconds introduces lag, increases overhead, and risks blocking the async executor if D-Bus calls are executed directly.
**Action:** Preserve dedicated threads for reactive event-based monitoring to ensure real-time responsiveness and avoid overloading the async task scheduler.

## 03-02-2025- Optimize audio visualiser with pre-calculated Hann window
**Learning:** Redundant trigonometric calculations in high-frequency hot loops (like audio DSP) can significantly increase CPU usage.
**Action:** Always pre-calculate static coefficients (like window functions) into lookup tables (arrays or vectors) outside the main processing loop to save thousands of redundant math operations per second.

## 04-02-2025- Offload Blocking Operations to Worker Threads
**Learning:** Mixing synchronous, CPU-intensive work (like image decoding) or blocking library calls (like D-Bus via the `mpris` crate) directly inside an async task stalls the Tokio executor, leading to frame drops and UI stutter.
**Action:** Always wrap heavy synchronous operations and blocking library calls in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. This offloads the work to a dedicated thread pool, preserving the responsiveness of the main async event loop.

## 05-02-2025- Optimize Histogram/Frequency Counting with Fixed-Size Arrays
**Learning:** For performance-critical loops with a small, bounded key space (like our 512-bucket color histogram), `std::collections::HashMap` introduces significant overhead due to hashing, heap allocations, and pointer chasing.
**Action:** Use fixed-size arrays (stack-allocated) and direct indexing for counting or lookup tasks whenever the key space is small and predictable. This typically results in a 2-3x speedup for those specific kernels.
